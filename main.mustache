### Hey, I'm avi12

I'm a {{age}}-year-old Israeli who loves programming and aims to make the world a better place
At day I'm working for [Next Insurance](https://nextinsurance.com). At night - I'm an independent developer (or gaming, or watching YouTube)
Although as of writing this README the majority of my projects are JavaScript-based, and indeed it's my favorite language, I don't "constraint" myself to it; I'll use whatever language that will enable me to solve the issue I'm facing
Plus, I'm fascinated by low-level coding (haven't written any low-level code yet)
