### Hey, I'm avi12

I'm a 23-year-old Israeli who loves programming and aims to make the world a better place  
Although as of writing this README the majority of my projects are JavaScript-based, and indeed it's my favorite language, I don't "constraint" myself to it - I'll use whatever language that will enable me to solve the issue I'm facing  
Plus, I'm fascinated by low-level coding (haven't written any low-level code myself, but I'm fascinated by the idea)

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:avi6106@gmail.com), [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/avi12) and Discord
